## How to Approach

Steps:

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

Now create Different Components to render it over a same page. As I created 4 components Navbar, SideIndicator, Title, Widget Circle.
Now this all components are rendered on App component and app component is rendered at index which show view Live.
